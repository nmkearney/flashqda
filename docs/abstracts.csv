"Multistrata agroforestry as an alternative to slash-and-burn farming in the Peruvian Amazon. One of the causes of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is slash-and-burn farming. As a viable alternative, we established and evaluated multistrata agroforestry systems around the town of Pucallpa (Ucayali region). Since 2007 till 2009, a total of 73 plots were established in nine villages, most of them on deforested and severely degraded soil. The system was based on cultivation of fast-growing indigenous fruit tree species Inga edulis as a key component, combined with other native fruit and timber trees. During early years of establishment, farmers intercrop trees with their own staple crops. In subsequent years, tree-growing prevented farmers from annual cropping, but there was space to grow shade-resistant crops, such as pineapple. The preferred incentives were based on providing farmers with quality tree seedlings, organizing communal exchange work and continuous technical assistance. During evaluation in 2012, altogether 46 plots out of 73 (adoption rate around 63%) were successfully maintained by the farmers. Regarding economic performance, the multistrata system could be more profitable, as compared to slash-and-burn system, but only if employing lower discount rate; farmers must employ appropriate management practices and need to have secure market for their tree products. The adoption rate could be increased by providing farmers with the right incentives for system establishment."
"Birds and bats enhance cacao yield despite suppressing arthropod mesopredation. Bird- and bat-mediated biocontrol benefits the productivity of tropical commodity crops such as cacao, but the ecological interactions driving these ecosystem services remain poorly understood. Whereas birds and bats prey on herbivorous arthropods, they may also prey on arthropod mesopredators such as ants, with poorly understood consequences for pest biocontrol. We used a full-factorial experiment excluding birds, bats, and ants to assess their effects on (a) the abundance of multiple arthropod groups; (b) predation pressure on arthropods evaluated through artificial sentinel caterpillars; and (c) cacao yield over 1 year in shaded agroforestry systems of native cacao varieties in Peru. Birds and bats increased cacao yield by 118%, which translates in smallholder benefits of ca. US $959 ha−1 year−1. Birds and bats decreased predation by ants and other arthropods, but contributed to the control of phytophagous taxa such as aphids and mealybugs. By contrast, ant presence increased the abundance of these sap-sucking insects, with negative impacts for cacao yield. Notably, high abundances of the dominant ant Nylanderia sp., known to attend sap-sucking insects, were associated with lower cacao yield along a distance gradient from the closest forest edge. According to these results, arthropod predation by birds and bats, rather than mesopredation by arthropods, was most responsible for increases in cacao yield. Moving forward, detailed research about their trophic interactions will be necessary to identify the cause of such benefits. Retaining and restoring the large benefits of birds and bats as well as minimizing disservices by other taxa in cacao agroforests can benefit from management schemes that prioritize preservation of shade trees and adjacent forests within agroforestry landscapes."
