Multistrata agroforestry as an alternative to slash-and-burn farming in the Peruvian AmazonOne of the causes of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is slash-and-burn farming. As a viable alternative, we established and evaluated multistrata agroforestry systems around the town of Pucallpa (Ucayali region). Since 2007 till 2009, a total of 73 plots were established in nine villages, most of them on deforested and severely degraded soil. The system was based on cultivation of fast-growing indigenous fruit tree species Inga edulis as a key component, combined with other native fruit and timber trees. During early years of establishment, farmers intercrop trees with their own staple crops. In subsequent years, tree-growing prevented farmers from annual cropping, but there was space to grow shade-resistant crops, such as pineapple. The preferred incentives were based on providing farmers with quality tree seedlings, organizing communal exchange work and continuous technical assistance. During evaluation in 2012, altogether 46 plots out of 73 (adoption rate around 63%) were successfully maintained by the farmers. Regarding economic performance, the multistrata system could be more profitable, as compared to slash-and-burn system, but only if employing lower discount rate; farmers must employ appropriate management practices and need to have secure market for their tree products. The adoption rate could be increased by providing farmers with the right incentives for system establishment.
